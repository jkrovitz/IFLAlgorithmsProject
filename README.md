# Pixel Sorting 

A project for Algorithm Design and Analysis (Macalester College Comp 221) completed by Luke Brown, Jeremy Krovitz, and Emma Thole. 

* Pixel sorting algorithms are image processing methods that reoganize pixels in various ways to create altered images. 

* Using an image of their choice, a user selects their sorting criteria. and the algorithms sort the pixels in the image based on user selection.  

* The pixels in the image are reorganized and saved as a new image.
